# Where is the Logic?

[![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Mooney91/layer-performance/badges/quality-score.png?b=main)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Mooney91/layer-performance/?branch=main)

This repo is in connection with a thesis project by Zachary Mooney. This is a comparative study of the performance of business logic between the Data and Application Layers of a Three-Tier System.

There are a series of tests that are executed to measure and compare performance (speed) of various functions performed either from the Data Layer or the Application Layer.

In addition, the database in the *Data Layer* will also be populated with three separate datasets: 1000, 50000, and 100000 row datasets.

## Data Layer

- MySQL
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Cassandra

## Application Layer

- Node.js
- Python
- PHP
